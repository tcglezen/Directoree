## Documentation 
The documentation is currently not built. One day tho...

## Background 
This seemed like something that should obviously exist, yet I couldn't find a python library to do it.
This work is inspired by my lack of ability to get [this](http://oldmanprogrammer.net/source.php?dir=projects/tree) to work.
